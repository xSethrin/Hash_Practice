README
 
In order to run this program the user MUST pass two strings as args[0] and args[1] 
followed by a int for args[2].  The file also REQUIRES a file named dictionary.txt 
in the same dirrectory in order to  run properly.  Failure to do so will cause 
the program to fail.

This program is a game, the user passes two words as well as a maximum hops.
If the words are the same length the program will find the shortest path from 
one word to the nextusing only valid words.  The program will then print the words
as well as the number of hops needed.
